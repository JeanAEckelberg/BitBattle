# BitBattle
Main repository to track process documents generated while building the BitBattle System

# Background

Several "AI"/Bot competition frameworks exist already. Of those that exist, MIT's Battlecode, UIUC's Mechmania, and NDSU's Byte-le Royale are some of the competitions we are most familiar with. The issue with these engines are that there are limited in options for languages and limited in file structure.

# Purpose & Scope

This new system aims to address the issues listed in the background section through the use of websocket communication, containerization and robust client support. A flexible & language-agnostic bot competition engine system.
